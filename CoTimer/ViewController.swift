        // third , so in order to store that broken values we define a container to store it 
        // also note that

    // inseconds method is geeting called and its return type " String " is getting captured
    // in constant named  "Counter" ,
    // once its getting captured in constant named counter its getting loaded on
    // label named inseconds ,is getting updated 
    //finally most important now , the global variable named count whose value was 0 at start is now getting updated by constant named counter
